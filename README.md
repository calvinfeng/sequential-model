# Time-series Data Prediction
## Datasets
For experimental data, download household power consumption dataset from
[UCI Individual Household Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)

Run `time_series_prediction.py` to experience HOW FUCKING AWESOME LSTM IS. You will need `keras` and
`tensorflow` as the backend for Keras.
```
virtualenv environment
source environment/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python time_series_prediction.py
```
